Jem game plan

Collect sounds (generic wind instruments at different notes)

Use sounds to solve puzzles, some parts can use any sound, some need specific sounds that can be unlocked, final door needs all.

Based on locks of doors to back rooms of Air Temples in Avatar: The Last Airbender, that need air bending to open by pushing air through, parts of the lock make sound.
